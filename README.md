[Youtube Decompilation](http://ytdc.dnlv.co/)
==

## Description
This is code of [my](https://danilov.me/) projects, that I call Youtube Decompilation.
It's based on [Youtube's API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/): set time to start and end video flow.
No, this code can't to separate YT-videofile to many videofiles. It's only try to set start and end time that Youtube's videoplayer (Flash and HTML5) must playing video. From one seconds to another, and not a second more.

Also this service can take a unique link with start and end time params, which you can share with your friends. And they used this link may watch a part of video, which you set.

## Development
Based on:
* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
* [Youtube's API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/)
